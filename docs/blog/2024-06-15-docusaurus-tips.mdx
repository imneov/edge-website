## Advanced MDX Features

One of the most powerful features of Docusaurus is its support for MDX, which allows you to use React components within your markdown content.

### Code Blocks with Tabs

You can create interactive code examples using tabs:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```javascript title="example.js"
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('Docusaurus');
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python title="example.py"
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet('Docusaurus')
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="go" label="Go">

```go title="example.go"
package main

import "fmt"

func greet(name string) {
    fmt.Printf("Hello, %s!\n", name)
}

func main() {
    greet("Docusaurus")
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Content Organization Tips

### Use Admonitions Effectively

Admonitions are great for highlighting important information:

:::tip Pro Tip
Use different types of admonitions to categorize information and make it more scannable for readers.
:::

:::warning Be Careful
Always test your configuration changes in development before deploying to production.
:::

:::info Did You Know?
Docusaurus automatically generates a table of contents from your heading structure!
:::

### Sidebar Organization

Structure your sidebar logically:

```typescript title="sidebars.ts"
const sidebars = {
  docs: [
    'intro',
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Getting Started',
      items: ['installation', 'configuration'],
    },
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Guides',
      items: ['writing-content', 'deployment'],
    },
  ],
};
```

## Performance Optimization

### Image Optimization

1. **Use appropriate formats**: WebP for modern browsers, PNG/JPG as fallback
2. **Optimize file sizes**: Compress images before adding to your site
3. **Use responsive images**: Consider different screen sizes

### Bundle Size

Keep your bundle size small by:
- Only importing components you actually use
- Using code splitting for large components
- Optimizing your custom CSS

## Deployment Best Practices

### GitHub Pages

For GitHub Pages deployment:

```bash
# Set up deployment
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy

# Or use GitHub Actions for automated deployment
```

### Custom Domain

1. Add a `CNAME` file to your `static` directory
2. Configure your DNS settings
3. Enable HTTPS in your repository settings

## SEO Optimization

### Meta Tags

Ensure each page has proper meta tags:

```markdown
---
title: Page Title
description: A clear description of the page content
keywords: [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3]
---
```

### Structured Data

Consider adding structured data for better search engine understanding:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "TechArticle",
  "headline": "Your Article Title"
}
</script>
```
